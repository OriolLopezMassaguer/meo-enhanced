# MEO Enhanced

This changelog retains the release history of the original Markdown Editor
Optimized project. New MEO Enhanced releases start from version 0.1.0.
---
## Unreleased
- Added CriticMarkup support for `{++add++}`, `{--delete--}`, `{~~old~>new~~}`, `{==mark==}` and `{>>note<<}` in Live, Source and Preview/export. Live hides the delimiters off the active line; Source tints the marks and keeps every character visible; Preview renders `critic-*` spans with a light/dark palette. A substitution is consumed as one unit, so its `~~` never pairs with Strikethrough. Marks inside code spans, fenced code and backslash escapes stay literal. A mark that opens in one block and closes in another (for example `{==` before a list and `==}` after it) is styled in Live and Source from the document text; Preview/export still render marks within a single block only. Marks inside headings and nested marks are not styled yet.
- Added the `meoEnhanced.appearance.criticMarkup` setting (off by default) with a checkbox in More tools and a switch in Settings > General. Off shows CriticMarkup as plain Markdown text in Live and Source; Preview is not affected.
- Added CriticMarkup review tools (they follow the same setting): Accept / Reject buttons over the mark under the cursor in Live and Source (one undoable change; a highlight and its glued comment resolve together); a selection-toolbar button that wraps the selection as `{==text==}{>>#cNN @author: <<}` with the next free id (author from `meoEnhanced.criticMarkup.author`, else `markdown-markup.author`); and a More tools list of the document's comments that jumps to each one.
- Preview and export render CriticMarkup comments as numbered notes that open on focus (click or Tab) and print expanded.
- CriticMarkup comments can carry a date after the author (`@Oriol 2026-10-18:`; new comments get today's date when `meoEnhanced.criticMarkup.dates` is on) and a resolved state (a leading `[x] `), toggled with a checkbox in the comments list, which can also hide resolved comments. The list also gains Accept all / Reject all, applied to the selection or the whole document in one undo step.
- Emphasis, links, code and inner marks now work inside a CriticMarkup mark in Live, Source and Preview (a comment body stays plain text; marks of the same kind cannot nest).
- CriticMarkup comment types: `[TODO]`, `[DUDA]`, `[FUENTE]`, `[REVISAR]` and `[OK]` right after the author (and after a resolved `[x] `) get their own color in Live and Source, a typed badge in Preview (`TODO 3`) and a tag in the comments list. Unknown tags stay plain text.
- Accept all / Reject all no longer clear open notes: additions, deletions and substitutions are always resolved, while a note (or a highlight with a note) is only cleared once it is marked `[x]`.
- The comment button no longer wraps a selection that already contains a highlight; it attaches the note after it. Mark scanning is cached per document, so moving the cursor does not rescan the text.

## 0.3.33
- Preserved Preview and Source split Preview reading positions when switching to native VS Code editor tabs with the outline open, including hidden Webview resizing and normal visible panel resizing.
- Added Whitey dark mode using Typora Whitey Deep's palette, with Auto/Light/Dark choices, per-document appearance memory, and matching custom preset examples and HTML/PDF exports.

## 0.3.32
- Validated retained Webview layout sizes against actual panel visibility, preventing an open outline from collapsing Preview during native tab switches while preserving normal resizing under VS Code's clipping containers.
- Distinguished visible small panels from parked Webviews using browser intersection geometry, preserving hidden-tab reading positions without treating a fixed viewport size as hidden.
- Coalesced reading-layout resize updates and removed synchronous layout reads from the resize handler, with coverage for adjacent small-panel sizes and different parked-frame dimensions.

## 0.3.31
- Fixed Source split Preview returning to the start when mouse tab switches park the retained Webview before its blur event. Reading layout protection now applies before tab deactivation, with regression coverage for both focus/parking orders and real panel resizing.

## 0.3.30
- Preserved Preview and Source split Preview reading positions when switching to native VS Code editor tabs with the document outline open. Retained tabs keep their reading layout while VS Code parks the Webview in a smaller iframe.
- Kept hidden-tab reflow from disturbing delayed image layout updates, with regression coverage for all built-in Preview presets and same-file or different-file native tabs.

## 0.3.29
- Removed build-machine paths from the PDF browser runtime and checked every packaged text file before release, while preserving relocated QuickJS/WASM proxy support.
- Added GitHub README and custom Preview presets, with import, update, sharing, visibility and removal controls in Settings. Preset authoring guides and examples are available on GitHub; HTML and PDF follow the selected preset and appearance while Word retains its fixed document format.
- Preserved the reading position when switching presets in full and split Preview, including rapid changes and late render responses.
- Added Obsidian wiki images and vault-aware resource lookup, with readable Unicode link targets.
- Added eight configurable UI colors and an independent document background, with live appearance previews, save/cancel controls, readable surface layers and consistent light, dark and high-contrast controls.
- Let Source inherit VS Code syntax colors and retain session caches, reducing repeated highlighting and work for hidden content.
- Kept the last valid Mermaid diagram visible during split edits, coalesced typing, reused cached results and prioritized current edits over obsolete background work.
- Unified input-method handling and popup placement for slash, path and emoji suggestions; restored comments for additional code languages and slash shortcuts on international keyboard layouts.
- Refined segmented controls, tooltips and candidate text hierarchy, and stabilized rendered-block editing, history, line numbers and mode transitions.
- Kept Preview copy controls paired with independent preset colors and synchronized matching default controls during live color changes. Preserved readable suggestion matches on selected rows.
- Prevented Source typing from briefly losing syntax colors inside tokens and at their boundaries, while invalidating replaced source until fresh highlighting arrives.
- Synchronized table source positions before focus after embedded block edits, and refreshed Mermaid control appearance together with diagram colors.
- Kept the Live reading line visible during font changes after tall tables, preventing repeated viewport jumps while block heights settle.
- Preserved measured table height when virtualized tables reappear, preventing temporary row collapse from interrupting Live scrolling.
- Kept Markdown formatting markers inside code, formulas, link destinations and titles, comments, and HTML code from affecting surrounding text; fixed pointer expressions being shown as italics in Live mode.
- Aligned punctuation-adjacent emphasis, strikethrough and highlighting across Live prose, tables, Preview, and HTML, PDF and Word exports.
- Corrected nested and mixed inline formatting, unmatched delimiters and incremental editing while preserving literal code and readable outline labels.

## 0.3.28
- Expanded bilingual settings search, editing assistance and configurable shortcuts, including image storage rules, contextual slash commands, link and emoji suggestions, and native table paste behavior.
- Kept Live code, Mermaid and math block controls visible while scrolling, and added hover copy controls for Mermaid source and LaTeX expressions in document Preview.
- Let floating block controls wait for geometry-only mode updates to settle, preventing CodeMirror measurement-budget warnings while preserving their first visible frame and cleanup.
- Unified link destination tooltips across prose, tables and Preview, with readable Unicode targets, localized prefixes, consistent modifier-key behavior and compact content-sized bubbles.
- Preserved search text and highlights across editor modes without delaying mode transitions or competing with navigation.
- Stabilized rendered block geometry, nested lists and quotes, table widths, scrolling and embedded-editor viewports through input and history changes; corrected clicking and selecting empty quoted lines.
- Kept explicit Live navigation authoritative while late rendered-block layouts settle, preventing distant targets from being pulled back out of view.
- Prevented window activity changes from stealing editor focus and improved keyboard focus feedback on preview controls.
- Harmonized inline-code spacing and colors, dark text contrast, and borderless block backgrounds between Live and Preview.
- Prevented Preview from announcing readiness for an initial blank iframe before its reading document is available.
- Kept adopted Live table widgets synchronized with later height measurements after multiline rows finish laying out.
- Unified logical text identity for CRLF document sync, local edits, save confirmations, Preview startup and split Preview disk reloads while preserving Host line endings.

## 0.3.27
- Improved caret continuity across window activation, toolbar and menu interactions, and Live/Source mode switches, including table cells, Mermaid, and math editors. Fixed reversed formula input when nearby tables were re-rendered. Kept typing carets visible through late layout changes without competing scroll corrections. Retired stale embedded-input positioning after undo/redo and external synchronization.
- Preserved Mermaid and math source/split choices across mode switches and kept new Source selections authoritative; restored HTML source positions when editing rendered content again.
- Centered offscreen Live table search matches in the usable viewport, accounting for floating table headers. Preserved the reading position during bulk replacement.
- Preserved automatic table column minimum widths after window resizing and manual widths through external document updates; kept HEX color controls aligned with editor scrolling.
- Added document recovery actions and safe copy saving, with native notifications for opening a saved copy or its containing folder.
- Made HTML, PDF, and DOCX exports use light document appearance independently of Preview's theme.
- Aligned Preview bold labels ending in punctuation with Live rendering and prevented time literals from being treated as emoji syntax.
- Reduced redundant highlighting, Preview DOM updates, and table-layout work; stabilized startup reading positions, late virtual-layout changes during Live scrolling, linked Preview geometry refreshes, and retryable Preview refreshes.
- Refined editor notices, split Preview controls, and content-sized Preview font controls; lowered the minimum VS Code version to 1.94.
