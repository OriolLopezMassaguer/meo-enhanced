## VS Code Markdown Math grammars

- Source: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/7debcd0e2acdea1c52de81bf9ee1620444407dda/extensions/markdown-math/syntaxes
- Version: VS Code 1.138.0
- Bundled grammar data: `webview/src/adapters/grammars/md-math*.json`
- The upstream math-body grammar credits rules from https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/blob/master/syntax/TeX.tmLanguage.json.
- Integration changes in `mathSyntaxGrammar.ts`: local Markdown injections, MEO's delimiters and fence aliases, container prefixes and unfinished inline input. The grammar data retains the upstream contributor notice.
